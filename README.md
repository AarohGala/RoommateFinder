SEng 18 Project 2

### Abstract

In this work, we have surveyed and examined the problems of communication gap and trust issues faced by current graduate students despite having social media groups to bond with each other for finding potential roommates. We look into the existing solutions developed and analyze the code as well as results in great details and propose an improved solution to solve this problem. We also demonstrate the inefficiencies of existing solutions and how we can modify those to improve the overall results. At the same time, we also propose radically different attributes and features that will help in making the application more dynamic, scalable, feature-rich and user-friendly.
